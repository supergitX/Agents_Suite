**Code Review**

The provided Python code defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns their division. However, the code does not handle a crucial case: division by zero.

**Issues:**

1. **Division by Zero Error**: The code will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when attempting to divide by zero, as seen in the example usage `print(divide_numbers(10, 0))`. This is because division by zero is undefined in mathematics.
2. **Lack of Error Handling**: The function does not include any error handling mechanism to catch and handle potential exceptions, such as `ZeroDivisionError`.

**Corrected Version**

python



**Changes:**

1. **Added Error Handling**: We introduced a simple check to raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the divisor `b` is zero.
2. **Used a Try-Except Block**: We wrapped the function call in a try-except block to catch the `ZeroDivisionError` and print a meaningful error message instead of letting the program crash.
3. **Added Documentation**: We included a docstring to describe the function's purpose, arguments, return value, and potential exceptions.
