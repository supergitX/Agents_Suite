**Code Review**

The provided Python function `sum_of_evens` calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list of integers. Here's an analysis of the code:

1. **Functionality**: The code is correct and achieves the desired functionality.
2. **Error Handling**: The code does not handle potential errors, such as:
	* Input validation: The function assumes that the input is a list of integers. It does not check for non-integer values or non-list inputs.
	* Empty list: The function returns 0 for an empty list, which might be the expected behavior.
3. **Code Style and Conventions**:
	* The code uses a descriptive variable name `sum_even`, but it can be more Pythonic.
	* The function name `sum_of_evens` is clear, but it does not follow the conventional naming style for functions (lowercase with underscores).

**Corrected Version**

Here's the corrected version of the code, addressing the mentioned issues:

**Changes Made**

* Added input validation to check if the input is a list of integers.
* Renamed `sum_even` to `even_sum` to follow Python's naming conventions.
* Used a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of even numbers in a more concise and Pythonic way.
* Added a `TypeError` exception to handle invalid input.
* Improved the docstring to include information about the raised exception.
