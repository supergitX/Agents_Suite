**Code Review**

The given Python code defines a function `divide_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their division result. However, there's a significant issue with this code.

**Issues:**

1. **Division by Zero Error**: The code does not handle the case when the divisor (`b`) is zero. In Python, attempting to divide a number by zero raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.
2. **Lack of Input Validation**: The function does not validate its inputs. It assumes that both `a` and `b` are numbers, but it does not check for this.

**Corrected Version**

python



In the corrected version:

* We added input validation to ensure both `a` and `b` are numbers.
* We raised a `ZeroDivisionError` if `b` is zero to handle this special case.
* We included a docstring to document the function's behavior and expected input types.
* We provided example usage with error handling to demonstrate how to use the function safely.
