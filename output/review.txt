## Code Review

The provided Python code calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given list of integers. The code is well-structured and readable, with a clear docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, and return value.

However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

*   **Error Handling:** The code does not include any error handling. If the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values, the code may fail or produce incorrect results.
*   **Type Checking:** The code does not enforce the type of the input argument. It assumes that the input will always be a list of integers, but it does not verify this.
*   **Docstring:** The docstring does not specify what happens if the input list is empty or if it contains no even numbers.

## Example Use Cases

python
# Test with a list of integers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 12

# Test with an empty list
numbers = []
print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))  # Output: 0

# Test with a list containing non-integer values
numbers = [1, 2, '3', 4, 5, 6]
try:
  print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))
except TypeError as e:
  print(e)  # Output: List must contain only integers

# Test with a non-list input
numbers = '123'
try:
  print(sum_even_numbers(numbers))
except TypeError as e:
  print(e)  # Output: Input must be a list
