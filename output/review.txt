## Code Review

The provided Python code defines a function `divide_numbers(a, b)` that takes two numbers as input and returns their division. However, there's a significant issue with the code. 

The problem arises when the function is called with `b` as 0, which leads to a **ZeroDivisionError**. In mathematics, division by zero is undefined, and Python reflects this by raising an exception when it encounters such an operation.

## Issues:

1. **Division by Zero**: The code does not handle the case when `b` is 0, which will result in a ZeroDivisionError.
2. **Error Handling**: The code lacks any form of error handling or input validation, which is essential for robustness and reliability.
3. **Code Readability**: Although the code is simple, it would be beneficial to include a docstring to explain what the function does and what it returns.

## Corrected Version

Here's the corrected version of the code with proper error handling and a docstring:

In this corrected version:

*   We've added type checking to ensure both `a` and `b` are numbers.
*   We've added a check for `b` being 0 and raise a ZeroDivisionError if so.
*   We've included a docstring to document the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and possible exceptions.
*   We've wrapped the function call in a try-except block to catch and handle any potential errors.
