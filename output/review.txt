## Code Review

The given Python code calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. However, there are a few potential issues that can be improved:

1. **Negative Input Handling**: The current implementation does not handle negative input values. Factorial is only defined for non-negative integers. If a negative number is passed to the function, it will cause a recursion error or a stack overflow.
2. **Non-Integer Input Handling**: The function does not check if the input is an integer. Factorial is only defined for integer values. If a non-integer value is passed, it may cause incorrect results or errors.
3. **Large Input Handling**: For large input values, the recursive approach can cause a stack overflow due to Python's recursion limit.

## Corrected Code

Here is a revised version of the code that addresses these issues:

python



Alternatively, you can use an iterative approach with a loop to calculate the factorial, which can be more efficient for large input values. This approach can also be implemented using the `math.prod` function:

python
import math

def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

    Args:
        n (int): A non-negative integer.

    Returns:
        int: The factorial of n.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is a negative integer or not an integer.
    """
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise ValueError("Input must be an integer.")
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")
    return math.prod(range(1, n + 1))

# Example usage
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
