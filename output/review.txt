### Code Review

The given Python code is a simple function `divide_numbers` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their division result. However, there's a significant issue with this code:

*   **Division by Zero Error**: The code does not handle the case where `b` is zero. In the example usage, `divide_numbers(10, 0)` will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined in mathematics.

### Corrected Code

To address this issue, we can add a check to ensure that `b` is not zero before performing the division. Here's the corrected code:

python



### Explanation of Changes

*   **Added Input Validation**: We added a check at the beginning of the `divide_numbers` function to ensure that `b` is not zero. If `b` is zero, we raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive message.
*   **Wrapped Example Usage in a Try-Except Block**: We wrapped the example usage of `divide_numbers(10, 0)` in a try-except block to catch and handle the `ValueError` exception that is raised when attempting to divide by zero.
*   **Added a Docstring**: We added a docstring to the `divide_numbers` function to provide documentation about its purpose, arguments, return value, and raised exception.
